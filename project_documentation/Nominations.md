Nominations

Introduction

Current problem.

The problem with how they do nominations is that they use e mails and  it is basically spam being sent around the employees and this approach is not efficient.

how the new system will work.

Once the employee has logged in using Yammer.
They will then be able to start using the system and one of the features in the system is the nominations.

The nominations function in mobile application is basically there for the purpose of allowing employees to nominate each other so that the best employee will be given a prize based on judgment made by other colleagues.

As part of the nominations the system will allow the user to do the following.

In the web application.

1. the HR Team / Comms will send a notification to all the users to make a nomination.

In the mobile application

1. Receive a notification to do nominations.
2. The user will  then be allowed to make a nominations following the sequence below.

  * select an employee from a list of recommended employees or select an employee they want to nominate.
  * Once an employee has been selected they will then write a comment why they selected that particular employee.
  * once they have written a comment they will be allowed to submit the nomination and an e mail will be sent to the comms team.
  
the images below describe the process.
