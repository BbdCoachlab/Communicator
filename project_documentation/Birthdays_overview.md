####Birthdays Functions####
The current issue is the use of emails to notify employees about birthdays, events and awards. 
This can create: 

-   a lot of emails flowing in ones inbox 
-   and causing spam emails.

In order to deal with the issue, the development of a mobile application will help reduce the problem. The BBD mobile application will handle birthday notification, awards and events notifications.

The Birthday function of the BBD mobile application, will allow for Comms/ HR to send birthday notifications to the BBD employees which will include subject line, message and includes adding an image .

On the mobile side, the application will allow empleyees to login using Yammer and when logged in, there will be an option of going to the birthdays function.

The mobile devices for each user, the screen will show:

-  the subject " Birthday",
-  the message "Happy birthday Mr X" and
-  an image of the person and a decoration image such as a birthday cake image.

The images will be stored in a server and pushed to the mobile application on the devices of the users to view. The application should be able to open this birthday function across all platforms including Android, iOS, Windows and BlackBerry.
