# Web Application  #
##Introduction
The communication and Human Resource teams at BBD use emails to do internal staff communications. This method of communication is not always effecient  as  it results in employees receiving ernomous amounts of emails. As a consequence, some employees end up ignoring these emails. In addition to the emails being ignored, some of the mails might be sent the junk mail (spam) which again they end up being unread.

The web application is aimed at bridging this communication problem (or challange). It will enable the Communication and Human Resources teams to create and send notifications to the the employees mobile phones. The web application will depend on the mobile application in order to communicate to the employees
##The Application

The main function of the web application is  creating and sending notifications to employees. To acheive this, the application sends each notification to the server. The server then pushes the notification to the mobile application.

The major notifications which will be created are:

- **Birthday Notification**: This is a base notification containing the subject, message and image.
 The web page for creating the would look like this:

- **Events Notifications**: This is a notification about events that will be happening in the business. These events can either be rsvp events such as year of end functions or non-rsvp events such as health awareness day. For the rsvp events, the employees have to send an rsvp to the Human resources team or the communication team. In addition to just sending an rsvp, employees can also state their dietary requirement, how many people will they bring to the event, and whether they need transport arrangements.  Whether an employee states their dietary requirements, transport arrangements or how many people they will bring will depend on the type of event.

A screen for events would look more similar to that of birthdays but with extra fields for:

           - rsvp or non-rsvp type events
           - stating number of people to bring along
           - stating dietary requirements
           - transport arrangements
          	
- **Awards**: The awards functionality is divided into two. The first one is a notification of people who won or a reminder to nominate. This functionality is similar to the birthday nitification and thus will be just a base notification with with a subject, image and message. The second functionality is nomination. This functionality allows employees to nominate the employer of the month based on the following categories: (i) The silent Operator, (ii) Helping your People, (iii) Ultimate BBD Agent, and (iv) Whatever It Takes.

## Other Functionality ##

In addition to the functionalities mentioned above, the web application will use Yammer Authentication to verify users. This means that members of the communication and Human resource teams need to have Yammer acccounts in order to use the web application and thus the mobile application to stream notifications to the employees. 

An example of a login page for the web would look like this:

## Conclusion ##
Effective communication is one of the important elements in business and in everyday life. The web application, together with the mobile application will try to provide an effecient method of communication between the Communications team  and the employees at BBD.
