### INTRODUCTION ##

The purpose of this document is to assist the users of the system,to make use of the features of the application.

The BBD communicator is a communication project assigned to the 2013 BBD coachlab students, to help with making communication at BBD more efficient. At the present moment, the HR/Comms team is using the BBD email address to send important messages to the rest of the employees. The problem with this line of communication is that the employee's emails are being flooded with messages outside their working scope, causing disturbance to the flow of their work. The employees are finding these messages as a form of a spam, causing a late reply back to the HR/Comms team and at times very important messages being ignored.
