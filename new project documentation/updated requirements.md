# BBD COMMUNICATOR #

## REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT ##


The purpose of this document is to clearly outline the project specification. It aims to assist both the client and the employees to have a better understanding on what the product can and cannot do. 

The BBD communicator is a communication project assigned to the 2013 BBD coachlab students, to help with making communication at BBD more efficient. At the present moment, the HR/Comms team is using the BBD email address to send important messages to the rest of the employees. The problem with this line of communication is that the employee's emails are being flooded with messages outside their working scope, causing disturbance to the flow of their work. The employees are finding these messages as a form of a spam, causing a late reply back to the HR/Comms team and at times very important messages being ignored.

The messages sent out by the HR/Comms team consists of:

Reminders about employees birthdays

Reminders to the BBD employees to nominate and vote for a colleague and announcements of the people who have won.

Invitations to events are sent out requiring the employees to RSVP, specify if they would be bringing a date and any special diet requirements that they would need.

Having employees ignore these messages,makes it difficult for the HR/comms team to prepare accordingly and makes communication about whats going on quite difficult.

In this document we will discuss the requirements for each function, starting with  login and birthday function, followed by nomination and concluding with events functionality.

## LOGIN #
All users will login using yammer. Yammer, is a social network service launched in 2008, it is used for private communication within organizations. 
The reason for the usage of yammer: is that firstly the client requested it, there will be no need to maintain the user-names and passwords for each employee.

The ability to login in to the web application, will be given only to the HR/Comms team where they will have excess that enables them to send messages of their desire.

Login in to the mobile application will be made available to all the users of the BBD Communicator

Although the decision to use yammer has been decided upon, the following disadvantages have been identified, the security is weak as any employee can change their job title to HR, they will be able to log on to the web application which is strictly assigned to the HR team. The other disadvantage is that if yammer is offline, the BBD communicator will not be able to work. 

## BIRTHDAY FUNCTION ##

####WEB APPLICATION###

When the HR/Comms team logs in to send a message to inform the company about someones birthday, the birthday function should allow the HR/Comms team to do the following:

1. Send a message to every employee
2. Write a subject(mandatory field)
3. Write a message
4. Upload a picture, no greater than 2MB
5. Send birthday messages individually


##CONCLUSION  

The remaining requirements of the BBD communicator will be updated as we keep proceeding further with the project. For now, the team will concentrate on getting the birthday function working from end to end, starting from the web app to the mobile app, using only android.
