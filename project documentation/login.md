**Login**

**Introduction.**

A login function will be used for the purpose of authenticating users and ensuring there is a security feature in the app.

Yammer is one of the optimal solutions we deciding to use for the purpose of the login function because there is already a database that has all the employees details in it and we do not have to create our own.

**description**

The application will make use of Yammer in order for a user to login.
One of the main requirements for a user to make use of the application is to have a Yammer account with BBD.

Once the user has provided the correct user-name and password which they use on Yammer then they will be allowed to be logged on the systems and make use of the system features.

if a user has a forgotten any of their login information they will have to recover all of it using Yammer and if they do not have a Yammer account they will not be able to use the application.
