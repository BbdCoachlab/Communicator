# Requirement Test Plan #
==============================================================================
## Introduction ##
This document aims at outlining the test plan for the BBD Communicator System. It describes the testing strategies and the approach that the BBD students will be using to verify that the application meets the established requirements.

 The main objectives system test is to make sure that the application meets the requirenments, specification and business rules.
## Test Strategy ##
The test strategy consists of two tests which will fully exercise the BBD Communicator system. The tests will
assist in uncovering system's limitations as well as measuring its  full capabilities.  
### System Test###
This test will focus on the behaviour of the BBD Communicator System. It will be testing the intergrated system (i.e the web application, database and mobile application) to make sure that it meets the specified requirements. User scenarios from both the HR/Comms side and employee side will be executed against the system.

### Automated Test###
Javascript unit test cases will be used to test the individual units of the source code which are associated with contol data, usage procedures, and operating procedures to make sure that they are fit to use. This test will be carried through the development of the system. 
##Enviroment##
The system testing environment will be used for the system testing. The coachlab mobile phones will also be used to do the system test on the mobile application.
##Control Procedures##
Once the testing has commenced system changes will be greately discouraged. However, should a defect be found in the testing phase a defect report should be completed. The developer for that component will then fix it. When the defect has been fixed the developer will then change the status of the defect to indicate its current state. The tester will then verify if the log has been fixed and then close the defect report on the defect log. 
## Functions to be Tested ##
 The following functions will be tested:

 - Creation of notification
 - Sending the notification to server
 - Updating of server information correctly
 - Retrieval of notifications
 - Readability of notifications
 - Response to notifications
 - Escape to return to main menu
 - Error Messages
 - Specific group notification messages

## Documentation ##
The following documantation will be available at the end of the test phase:

 - Test plan
 - Test cases
 - Requirements Validation Matrix
 - Defects Report
 - Final Test Summary report

Note that each tester will have to write down their test cases, complete the requirements validation matrix, defects report and write down their test summary.  The group will agree on the templates.
##Risks##
The schedule of the System development is very aggressive and a slip one development phase might affect the testing and thus the completetion of the system. Close  project management is very crucial and all memebrs of the team should look to it that everyone else is doing their job. In order to avoid delays the test will be executated  parallel to the production.

##Schedule##
The schedule for testing has been included in the project plan and each the system testing will be part of the testing from the start.
