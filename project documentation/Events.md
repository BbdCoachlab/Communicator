##Events##

###Introdution###

Currently event reminders at BBD are handled as follows. The communications/HR team sends out a reminder email to **all** of the employees at BBD, even if the event is only open to a certain group/department within BBD. The email contains a link which takes the user to a web-page which contains RSVP questions such as:

- Are you attending the event?
- What special dietary requirements do you have?
- Are you bringing a date? If so who?
- Will you require the services of Goodfellas?

The information is then sent back to the Communications/HR department.

Instead of redirecting a user to another site the proposed mobile application will have all of the above mentioned RSVP functionality built in.

###Description: Events Function###

The proposed application will have the following Events function properties:

- Event notifications/reminders will only be sent to the groups that they relate to.
- Event notification/reminders will only be sent to users who have not yet responded to the event.
- The application will only ask the user, event relevant, RSVP questions. (for example if the event has no catering then there is no need to ask about dietary requirements).
- The application will send the user response as an email to the Communications/HR department.
